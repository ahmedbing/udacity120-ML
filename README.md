Solutions of Udacity Machine Learning course ud120

Solutions of Udacity Machine Learning course ud120 are here.

Some of the code blocks are avaliable and working on python2 which is created by Udacity instructors. However, some parts of it not working on python3 or causing error mesages. That parts are updated and fixed according to python3 for users.

This repo had no purpose like creating most accurate or efficient solutions for problems. It is just a base at ML and some python libraries for beginners or at least for me:)
